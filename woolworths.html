Woolworths operates 155 full line stores, 52 Fashion, Beauty and Home only stores and 194 food stand alone stores in South Africa,[when?] with 68 stores throughout the rest of Africa.[when?] Woolworths sells clothing and accessory items under a number of premium brands, namely Studio W, RE: and Edition, with the Group's Australian brands Country Road, Witchery and Trenery also represented.</p>
